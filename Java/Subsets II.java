/*
Given a list of numbers that may has duplicate numbers, return all possible subsets

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
If S = [1,2,2], a solution is:

[
  [2],
  [1],
  [1,2,2],
  [2,2],
  [1,2],
  []
]
Note
Each element in a subset must be in non-descending order.
The ordering between two subsets is free.
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
Challenge
Can you do it in both recursively and iteratively?
